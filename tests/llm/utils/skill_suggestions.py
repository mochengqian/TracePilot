"""Helpers for the SuggestSkills closed-loop evals.

The SuggestSkills frontend tool (defined in
tests/llm/fixtures/shared/skill_suggestion_tool.yaml, mirroring the Robusta
UI) emits skill suggestions with the shape
``{title, symptoms, instructions, alerts, importance}``. This module
extracts those suggestions from a run's tool calls and renders them as
SKILL.md files so a replay pass can load them through the SkillsToolset —
closing the loop: a skill captured in one investigation must actually pay
off in the next.

Ported from the claude/consolidated-skills-per-domain branch and adapted to
the SuggestSkills suggestion schema (freeform instructions, no
skill_domain/consolidation — one SKILL.md per suggestion).
