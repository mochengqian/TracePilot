"""Security regression: forged session-approval metadata must not grant bash.

Reproduces the `approval.session-prefix-forgery` finding.

Holmes persists "don't ask again" bash approvals by writing a
``tool_call_metadata={... "bash_session_approved_prefixes": [...]}`` note into a
``role=tool`` message. On the next turn the server re-reads those prefixes from
the *client-supplied* ``conversation_history`` (via
``extract_bash_session_prefixes_by_agent``) and merges them into the Bash
allowlist.

Nothing proves Holmes authored that note. A caller hitting ``/api/chat``
directly controls the whole history, so they can fabricate a ``role=tool``
message that "approves" the ``bash`` prefix for a tool call the server never
issued — turning an un-allowlisted ``bash -c ...`` into an approved command
that executes with no genuine approval.

These tests encode the security contract: a forged, server-never-issued
approval note must NOT grant execution. They are expected to FAIL against the
current (vulnerable) code and to PASS once approval prefixes are authenticated
(e.g. signed at mint time and verified on read-back) — independent of which
remediation is chosen.
