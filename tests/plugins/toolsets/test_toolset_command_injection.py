"""Systemic regression tests for the command-injection class.

Background (ROB-893): built-in YAML toolsets run their
``command``/``script`` with ``shell=True`` after Jinja-rendering LLM-supplied
parameters. Parameters are sanitized with ``shlex.quote`` (see
``holmes.core.tools.sanitize``), which wraps a dangerous value in SINGLE quotes
(``$(id)`` -> ``'$(id)'``). That is safe ONLY in an *unquoted* shell token. When
a ``{{ param }}`` is interpolated INSIDE a double- or single-quoted slot, the
injected quote closes the surrounding quote and ``$(...)`` command substitution
stays active -> arbitrary code runs on the Holmes host.

The kubernetes toolset was the first fix; the same class was then found in
``slab``, ``kubevela``, ``inspektor_gadget`` and ``aks``. These tests guard the
WHOLE class across every built-in YAML toolset so it can't silently return:

1. ``test_no_param_interpolated_inside_quotes`` - a fast static scan asserting no
   executed ``command``/``script`` places a ``{{ param }}`` inside a quoted
   shell context.
2. ``test_no_command_substitution_executes`` - the behavioural proof: render each
   tool exactly as ``YAMLTool`` does and execute it under ``/bin/bash`` with a
   battery of injection payloads in each parameter, asserting nothing runs.
