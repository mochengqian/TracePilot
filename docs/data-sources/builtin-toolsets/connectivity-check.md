# Connectivity Check ✓

!!! info "Enabled by Default"
    This toolset is enabled by default and should typically remain enabled.

The connectivity check toolset provides basic TCP network connectivity verification. It allows HolmesGPT to test if specific hosts and ports are reachable using TCP socket connections.

This toolset is useful for troubleshooting network connectivity issues, verifying service availability, and validating that TCP services are listening on expected ports.

## Configuration

```yaml
holmes:
    toolsets:
        connectivity_check:
            enabled: true
            config: # optional
              # Internal destinations must be named here before they can be probed.
              # Accepts hostnames (matching subdomains), bare IPs, and CIDRs.
              allowed_hosts:
                - prometheus.monitoring.svc
                - 10.96.0.0/12
              allow_all_hosts: false     # true = skip the allowlist requirement
              block_internal_ips: true   # enforce the destination policy
              block_private_ips: false   # true = refuse private even if allowlisted
              max_probes: 60             # probes per window (0 disables)
              probe_window_seconds: 60   # must be > 0
```

!!! warning "Probing internal addresses requires configuration"
    Private/RFC1918 destinations are refused unless you list them in
    `allowed_hosts`. If you use `tcp_check` against in-cluster services, add
    them (or their CIDR) to `allowed_hosts` — otherwise the probe is refused
    with a message naming this setting.

    If you'd rather not maintain an allowlist, set `allow_all_hosts: true` (or
    the `HOLMES_CONNECTIVITY_CHECK_ALLOW_ALL_HOSTS` environment variable) to
    probe any internal destination at your own risk. Holmes logs a warning at
    startup while it is on. It does not unblock cloud-metadata or loopback —
    see [SSRF protection](#ssrf-protection) for how it interacts with
    `block_internal_ips` and `block_private_ips`.

### SSRF protection

The probe target (`host`) is chosen by the LLM, and that choice can be
influenced by untrusted observability data (indirect prompt injection).
`tcp_check` returns distinguishable open / refused / filtered outcomes, which is
all that is needed to enumerate hosts and ports — so left unguarded it is a
blind internal-network scanner sitting inside your trust boundary. The toolset
therefore applies this policy:

- **Cloud metadata / loopback are blocked.** Requests to `169.254.0.0/16`
  (incl. `169.254.169.254`), loopback, link-local, multicast, reserved and
  unspecified addresses are rejected. The connection is made to the validated IP
  so DNS rebinding cannot redirect the probe.
- **Private/cluster destinations must be named.** RFC1918 and other private
  addresses are refused unless they match `allowed_hosts`. Probing internal
  services is the tool's legitimate purpose, so the operator names the ones that
  matter rather than the whole range being open. Entries may be hostnames
  (`db.internal` also matches `primary.db.internal`), bare IPs, or CIDRs
  (`10.96.0.0/12`).
- **An allowlist is exhaustive.** Once `allowed_hosts` is non-empty, public
  destinations outside it are refused too, and listed destinations are exempt
  from the internal-IP block so you can deliberately target a specific endpoint.
  That exemption applies only while `allow_all_hosts` is off (see below).
- **Public destinations stay reachable with no configuration**, so ordinary
  external connectivity checks work out of the box.
- **Probes are rate limited** to `max_probes` per `probe_window_seconds` so a
  broad allowlist cannot be swept quickly. The counter is per Holmes process and
  shared across concurrent investigations, so keep it above normal use; set
  `max_probes: 0` to disable.
- **Every probe is logged** — allowed and refused alike — so scanning is visible
  in the Holmes logs.
- **`allow_all_hosts: true` waives the allowlist requirement** for deployments
  that don't want to maintain one: private/internal destinations become
  probeable again, at your own risk, and a warning is logged at startup. It can
  also be set with the `HOLMES_CONNECTIVITY_CHECK_ALLOW_ALL_HOSTS` environment
  variable, so no config change is needed. It never unblocks cloud-metadata,
  loopback or link-local — only `block_internal_ips: false` does that, and it
  does so independently of this setting, so a deployment that sets both gets
  the unrestricted behaviour of `block_internal_ips: false`.
  `block_private_ips: true` still overrides it. If
  `allowed_hosts` is also set, `allow_all_hosts` wins (and says so in the log):
  the entries are ignored **entirely** — they neither restrict destinations nor
  exempt one from the metadata/loopback block, so an entry like
  `169.254.0.0/16` cannot reopen the metadata range through this flag. To
  deliberately target a protected address, leave `allow_all_hosts` off and name
  it in `allowed_hosts`.
- `block_private_ips: true` refuses private destinations outright, even
  allowlisted ones, and independently of `block_internal_ips`.
- Set `block_internal_ips: false` only in trusted, isolated environments: it
  removes the metadata/loopback and allowlist-for-private checks, leaving only
  `block_private_ips` (if set) between the model and any address.
