    """Load skills from all sources and merge into a single catalog.

    Filesystem skills (builtin, then user) are keyed by name, so a user skill overrides a
    same-named builtin. Remote and personal skills are keyed by UUID.

    `user_id` must be the END USER's id from the request -- personal skills load only when it
    is present, keeping them out of server-initiated flows (alert triage, triggered
    workflows, scheduled prompts). Never pass SupabaseDal.user_id: that is Holmes's own
    service identity and would leak an identity into unattended runs.

    `hierarchy` controls cross-tier collision resolution; None or disabled (the default)
    means no dedup at all.

    `alert_name` is the firing alert's GroupedIssues.aggregation_key, set only for alert
    investigations. Present, it drops skills scoped to other alerts; absent (chat, CLI)
    nothing is filtered.
