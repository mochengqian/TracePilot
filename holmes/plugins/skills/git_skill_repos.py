"""Git-synced skill repositories.

Holmes can keep one or more git repositories of skills checked out locally and
re-pull them periodically, so pushed skill changes reach a running agent without
a pod restart. Each repo is published to skill loaders through an atomic symlink
flip (a detached worktree per commit, `current` pointing at the active one), so a
catalog scan never sees a half-updated tree: `scan_skill_directory` resolves the
symlink once at scan start and walks a stable checkout.

Configured via `skill_repos` in the Holmes config, or the SKILL_REPOS env var
holding the same list as JSON (how the Helm chart passes it). Credentials are
never written to disk: the token is read from the env var named by `token_env`
and injected into the fetch URL per git invocation only.

        credential cannot be produced (token_env names an unset variable, or the
