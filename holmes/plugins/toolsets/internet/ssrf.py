"""SSRF protection for the internet toolsets.

``fetch_webpage`` (and the Notion variant) let the LLM choose an arbitrary URL.
Because the URL can be dictated by attacker-controlled observability text
(indirect prompt injection), an unguarded ``requests.get`` is a Server-Side
Request Forgery + data-exfiltration primitive: the model can be steered to
``http://169.254.169.254/...`` (cloud metadata), cluster-internal services, or
``http://attacker.tld/?x=<secrets>``.

This module centralises the defense so every caller of ``scrape()`` is protected:

* only ``http``/``https`` schemes are allowed;
* the host is resolved and every resolved address is rejected if it falls in a
  loopback / link-local / private / reserved / multicast / unspecified range
  (unless an operator allowlist explicitly opts the host in);
* the socket connection is pinned to the exact IP that was validated, so a DNS
  rebind between validation and connection cannot swap in an internal address
  while keeping the original hostname for the ``Host`` header, TLS SNI and cert
  verification.
